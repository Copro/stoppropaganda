# StopPropaganda

Russia has invaded Ukraine and commited various war crimes. Russian media says that Russia has not commited any war crimes, has no casualties and doing this to protect Ukrainians from...Ukraine.

I believe that Russian propaganda websites should be down for their propaganda, therefore I created a simple DOS application that can be deployed almost anywhere.
